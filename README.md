Grunt task for http://www.localeapp.com service. Localeapp is a cloud service which provide a managment 
interface for translation files. 

They have developped a [ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/localeapp) to interact with their service.

The gem comes with some CLI command listed below :

## Getting Started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
gem install localeapp
npm install grunt-localeapp --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-localeapp');
```

> You can also use `load-grunt-tasks` to avoid these kind of inclusions.

## The "localeapp" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `localeapp` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({

  ...

  localeapp: {
    pull: {
      key: "tAbgRC2RemnJye2tLqwc1Y8xoyTUIVqZExlyFM0BlFo0YvCsgB",
      format: "json",
      dest: '<%= yeoman.app %>/locales/'
    }
  },

  ...

});
```

### Options

#### pull

All arguments are required

`key` : This identifier is provided by _localeapp.com_ in the Settings section of a project. It is a
project-specific information that will allow you to authenticate through their service and specify 
the project you are looking for.

`format` : Basicly, _localeapp.com_ only exports to yaml format. This options indicates the desired
output format. Available format are listed below :

format | translation tool
------ | ----------------
yml    | _native_
json   | [yamljs](https://www.npmjs.org/package/yamljs)

`dest` : Destination folder where the locale files will be pulled (must end with a '/').

> Output example :
 ```
 03:27:12 {tp-i18n} ~/projets/saas$ grunt i18n-update
